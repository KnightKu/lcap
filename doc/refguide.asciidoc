== Presentation ==
Lustre Changelog Aggregate & Publish is a lustre changelog proxy that allows
to pre-process and distribute lustre changelog streams to multiple consumers.
Typically, it permits distributed processing of the stream. Dedicated modules
can additionally pre-process the stream in order to reorder or filter out
records to best match what the end-process expects.

== Build ==

Besides a regular libc, LCAP depends on the following libraries:
  - libzmq (lzmq)
  - liblustreapi (llustreapi)

  +sh autogen.s+
  +./configure.sh+
  +make+

or optionally:
  +make rpms+
